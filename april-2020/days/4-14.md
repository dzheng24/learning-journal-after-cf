It felt really good to be able to finish the [filter practice](../exercises/filter-practice.js), and work on the "reduce method" problems today. It's interesting back in 301, how I struggled badly to solve these problems, and now they seem much easier. Even if I get stuck on a problem, I don't feel that "uneasy" feeling I used to get. 

Today's [reduce practice](../exercises/reduce-practice.js) was super helpful, definitely made me have a deeper understanding of it now.
