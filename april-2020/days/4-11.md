For my warm up today, I practiced the three elementary sorting methods (Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort). It's a great way to get my mind ready! I will mix it up with the routine I've been doing since mid February. 

Finished the "stretch goals" from yesterday, and started to practice object iteration today.

One problem I got stuck for a long time today was the use of `g` in a "regex test" problem, by not adding the `g`, it helped me solve the problem. [this post helped me](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12993629/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-g-flag-in-regular-expressions)

Another problem I got stuck on was that I kept receiving an `undefined` when I was trying to `return true`. Digging through Stackoverflow, this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48896509/return-true-actually-returns-undefined) helped me on solving the problem. I got introduced to the `.some()` method.
