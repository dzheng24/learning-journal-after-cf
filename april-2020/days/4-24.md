Thank you Ryan for being a big part of my career transition. :) 

Spent a long time moving and driving today. Continued to practice two dimensional arrays after dinner. It took me a long time to come up a solution for [question 2](../exercises/two-dimension-arrays.js), and I'm sure there is a better way to do it.
