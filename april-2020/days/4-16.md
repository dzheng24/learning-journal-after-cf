I received the job offer today. :) 

I am so grateful for this opportunity, thank you Amazon.

I am thankful for all the great people I've met since I started learning to code. I appreciate all the help, all the feedback, all the laughs.

Thank you, Lance and Jennifer, my Washington family, without you, none of this would've happened.
