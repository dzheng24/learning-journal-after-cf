Today I reviewed quick sort. It is a challenging one to implement in code. 

## Which Sort is Best? 
- Insertion Sort: Used with small input, and items are sorted; uses small space
- Bubble Sort: Only used for educational purposes (very rarely used)
- Selection Sort: Only used for educational purposes 
- Merge Sort: Very good because of divide & conquer, O(n log n); O(n) of space complexity
- Quick Sort: Average case of O(n log n); O(log n) of space complexity; downside is the worst case, if it has a bad pivoting point
