Today I practiced various array and string methods, which included slice, split, join, and splice. I will finish up the "stretch goals" tomorrow. 

Also reviewed insertion sort, I will now include the three basic elementary sorts: bubble, selection, and insertion sort to be part of my daily warm up routine. At least for a couple of weeks.
