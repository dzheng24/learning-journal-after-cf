I had my behavioral interview with Amazon's SDE Apprentice Program yesterday. I should hear back within the next few days. The interview itself was a great experience to practice. I liked preparing for it as well. 

Today after the warmup, I practiced async functions, and practiced the sort method. I will work on the two stretch goals for tomorrow.
