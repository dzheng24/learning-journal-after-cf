## Primitive Types in Java

### Primitive Types 
- Boolean: true or false 
- Int: whole number
- Double: decimal number
- Char: single letter or symbol 

What if I want to store and reference text?

### Reference Types 
- String: a sequence of ordered characters (for example, a word or person's name);

- A string is built out of characters; it is not a basic data type 

- **string value**: "speaker"
- **string variable**: string myFavoriteWord = "speaker";
- **Order of letters matters**: "desserts" does not have the same value as "stressed" because the characters are in different order
