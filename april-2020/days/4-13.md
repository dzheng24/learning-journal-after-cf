## Reviewing MVC 
- Model View Controller
- Software Architectural Design Pattern
- One of the most frequently used patterns
- Separates application functionality
- Promotes organized programming 

### Model (Brain of Application)
- Data related logic
- Interactions with database (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Communicates with controller 
- Can sometimes update the view (Depends on framework)

### View 
- What the end user sees(UI)
- Usually consists of HTML/CSS
- Communicates with the Controller 
- Can be passed dynamic values from the controller 
- Template Engines 

### Controller (Like a Middle Man)
- Receives input (from view, url)
- Processes requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Gets data from the model 
- Passes data to the view
