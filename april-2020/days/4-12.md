I got stuck on testing one of the [object iteration problems](../exercises/object-iteration.js) today. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the testing framework itself, since both problems were passing the test individually. However, after a quick chat with my roommate, I realized the array was altered in the previous problem, which caused issues for the next problem. 

It was a great learning and debugging experience.
