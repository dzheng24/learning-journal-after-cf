# 4/3/20 Friday 

In the morning, after my daily warmups, I practiced the forEach code challenges from 301. It was very helpful, and I fixed some Github security issues through that. 

At 12:15, JB from Code Fellows did a video talk about working remote. It was super informative. 

Spent the rest of the day preparing for my upcoming interview.
