"Stutter" Problem

This little challenge took me a long time today:

Write a method stutter that takes an ArrayList of Strings and an integer k as parameters and that replaces every string with k copies of that string. For example, if the list stores the values ["how", "are", "you?"] before the method is called and k is 4, it should store the values ["how", "how", "how", "how", "are", "are", "are", "are", "you?", "you?", "you?", "you?"] after the method finishes executing. If k is 0 or negative, the list should be empty after the call.

Got some good practice on debugging and ArrayList.

```java
  public static void stutter(ArrayList<String> list, int k) {
        if (k <= 0) {
            list.clear();
        }
        int initialSize = list.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < initialSize * k; i += k) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k - 1; j++) {
                list.add(i + j, list.get(i));
            }
        }
        System.out.println(list);
    }
```
