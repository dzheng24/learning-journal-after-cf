Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

- Resizable compute capacity
- Scale capacity s your computing requirements change
- Pay only for capacity that you actually use
- Choose Linux or Windows
- Deploy across AWS Regions and Availability Zones for reliability
- Use tags to help manage your Amazon EC2 resources

- Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types that are optimized for different use cases and workload requirements.
- Most AWS instance types include the latest generation Intel Xeon processors.

## XOR Operation in an Array (LeetCode 1486)

My solution:

```java
class Solution {
  public int xorOperation(int n, int start) {
    int[] numsArray = new int[n];
    int result = 0;
    // create the array
    for (int i = 0; i < numsArray.length; i++) {
      numsArray[i] = start + 2 * i;
    }
    // iterate through the array, get the result;
    for (int i = 0; i < numsArray.length; i++) {
      result ^= numsArray[i];
    }
    return result;
  }
}
```

Through this code challenge, I learned that a **bitwise XOR** is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only one of the bits is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1.
