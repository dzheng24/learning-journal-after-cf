- "Tightly Coupled" - components are strongly tied to each other.
- Adding resources greatly increases complexity.

Amazon SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service

- "First in first out"
- Store all message queues and messages within a single, highly-available AWS Region with multiple redundant Availability Zones
- Use asynchronous processing to get your responses from each step quickly
- Increase the number of job instances
- Easily recover from failed steps since messages will remain in the queue

- "Dead letter queue" is more for troubleshooting
- "Visiblity timeout" - how long the message lasts w/in the queue
- "Long polling" - database pulls from queue, not the other way

Microservices

- Applications composed of independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.
- The idea of a microservices architecture is to take a large, complex system and break it down into independent, decoupled services that are easy to manage and extend.
- Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda provide the perfect combination of web services to effortlessly build, deliver, and maintain a suite of microservices that can be the foundation of complex software systems.

Containers

- What problems do they solve?
  - getting software to run reliably in different environments
    - dev's workstation
    - production
    - test environment
- Contains all of your dependencies, configurations, hooks into OS

AWS Lambda

- Fully managed compute service
- Runs stateless code
- Runs your code on a schedule or in response to events

- handles:

  - servers
  - capacity needs
  - deployment
  - scaling and fault tolerance
  - OS or language updates
  - Metrics and logging

- Enables you to bring your own code
- Run code in parallel
- Create back ends, event handlers, and data processing systems
- Never pay for idling resources

API Gateway

- Allows you to create APIs that act as "front doors" for your applications
- Handles up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls

- Prevents exposing endpoints
- Protection from DDoS and injection attacks
