Today I worked on [Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/) Sequence problem. 

It was a challenging one; my friends [Chris](https://github.com/cdcummings10) and [Kyungrae](https://github.com/jeremymaya) helped me, and this [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/discuss/15995/Examples-of-nth-sequence) in C# guided my thought process. 

I'm still trying to understand the current solution better. I will be looking it over again tomorrow with a fresh set of eyes. 

This is what I have right now; I will remove the console logs at the next ACP. 
```js
function countAndSay(n) {
  if(n <= 0) return '-1';
  let result = '1';
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    console.log('i is ', i)
    result = build(result);
  }
  console.log('final result is ', result)
  return result;
}

function build(result) {
  console.log('the result currently is ', result)
  let stringBuilder = new Array();
  let p = 0;
  while (p < result.length) {
    console.log('p is ', p + ' and result is ', result)
    let val = result.charAt(p);
    let count = 0;

    while (p < result.length && result.charAt(p) === val) {
      p++;
      count++;
    }
    stringBuilder.push(count);
    stringBuilder.push(val);
  }
  console.log('builder is ', stringBuilder)
  return stringBuilder.join('');
}
```

I struggled a lot trying to solve this problem. Some solutions online didn't make a lot of sense to me. Thanks again to my friend Kyungrae that showed me this solution in C#. I like the modularity of this code.
