Sitting in my aisle seat on row 33, reading more from that article about git.

- `git fetch` does not mess with your working tree at all. 
- To bring changes from the remote branch to your working tree, I have to do a `git merge`. 
- For example, if I'm working on my local "master" branch, after a `git checkout master`, then I can merge in the changes from the "origin" with `git merge origin/master`.
- If I just want to see the differences between my local branch and the remote one: `git diff master origin/master`. 

- By doing `git fetch` followed by `git merge`, you have a better understanding of the branches' differences, and much safer than `git pull`. 

I really appreciated this 10 day California trip. It felt amazing to see my family; my little niece Nana, who is so adorable and articulate. I got to enjoy the sunshine, skateboarding, and was reminded how fun frisbee is!
