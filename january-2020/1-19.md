## SOLID Design Principles 

[Single-Responsibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQqY3_6Epbg&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH9kocFX7R7BAe_CvvOCO_p9) - Every class, function, or module of your code should have only one responsibility. The code should only have __one__ reason to change. 

[Open-Closed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ptMtJAdj40&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH9kocFX7R7BAe_CvvOCO_p9&index=2) - Every class, function, or module of your code should be open for extension, and closed for modification. To add functionality, you wouldn't need to go into the class and change it. 

I will continue to review the other principles.

Today's code challenge is called "search insert position":
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/

My code: 
```js
function searchInsert (nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === target) {
      return i;
    }
    if (nums[i] < target && nums[i + 1] > target) {
      return i + 1;
    }
    if (nums[0] > target) {
      return 0;
    }
    if (nums[nums.length - 1] < target) {
      return nums.length;
    }
  }
}
```
