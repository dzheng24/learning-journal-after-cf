Today I had my whiteboard interview with Jacob. I passed. :)
- Some takeaways from today:
  * step through the problem after algorithm/during pseudocode, instead of later during actual code
  * avoid spending too long on writing input and output 
  * take ownership of your code, test it, try to find cases that make it fail


Before my meeting with Jacob, I reviewed recursion and depth-first traversal for trees. It helped alot when I drew a stack, and placed each node into the stack as I practiced different traversal methods (pre-order, inorder, postorder). 

This is my next code challenge problem to practice:

## What is the difference between array and object in JavaScript?

  - Objects represent "things" with different characteristics (aka properties). 
  - Arrays create and store list of data in a single variable. 

  - Both dot notation and bracket notation allows us to access object. 
  - Zero-based indexing and other methods allows us to access array. 

  - Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections.
