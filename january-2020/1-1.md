Today I worked on the "two sum" problem again, this time with a sorted array. I used a two pointer method for this one. 

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/

Here's the code:
```js
function twoSum (numbers, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = numbers.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    let sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
    if (sum === target) {
      return [left + 1, right + 1]
    } else if (sum < target) {
      left ++;
    } else {
      right --;
    }
  }
  return 'numbers in the array do not add up to the target';
}
```

## Reading about Linked List vs. Array
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-vs-array/

Both Arrays and Linked List can be used to store linear data of similar types, but they both have some advantages and disadvantages. 

### Key Differences
- In an array, elements belong to indexes; i.e., to get to the 4th elemenet, you have to write the variable name with its index or location within the square bracket.
- In an linked list, you have to start from the head and work your way through until you get to the 4th element. 

- Accessing an element in an array is fast, while LL takes linear time. 

- Operations like insertion and deletion in arrays consume a lot of time. It's much faster in LL. 

- Elements are stored consecutively in arrays whereas it's randomly stored in LL.
