Today's challenge is about merging two sorted linked list. Here's my code after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K63Mjf-H0B0&t=332s)

```js
function ListNode(val) {
  this.val = val;
  this.next = null;
}

function mergeTwoLists(l1, l2) {
  let test = new ListNode(-1);
  let newHead = test;
  while (l1 !== null && l2 !== null) {
    if (l1.val < l2.val) {
      test.next = l1;
      l1 = l1.next;
    }
    else {
      test.next = l2;
      l2 = l2.next;
    }
    test = test.next;
  }
  if (l1 !== null) {
    test.next = l1;
  }
  else {
    test.next = l2;
  }
  return newHead.next;
}
```

I found an interesting "Tic Tac Toe" tutorial video on Youtube. This will be my next project to work on, as it will help me get better at CSS using grid, as well as JavaScript.

It snowed in Seattle today. :)
