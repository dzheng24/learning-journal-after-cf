## Continuing Reviewing Stacks and Queues

### Stacks Continued...

**Push O(1)**
Pushing a node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. 

```
Algorithm push(node)
  Node.next = top
  top = node
```
**Pop O(1)**
Popping a node off a stack is the action of removing a node from the top. 

```
Algorithm pop()
  temp = top
  top = top.next
  temp.next = null
  return temp
```

**Peek O(1)**

```
Algorithm peek()
  return top
```

### Queue
Common queue terminologies:
1. Enqueue - nodes that are added to the queue.
2. Dequeue - nodes that are removed from the queue.
3. Front - this is the front/first node of the queue.
4. Rear - this is the rear/last node of the queue. 
5. Peek - Viewing the top node in the queue

Queues follow these concepts:
**FIFO**: First In First Out, first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue. 
**LILO**: Last In Last Out, the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue. 

**Enqueue O(1)**

```
Algorithm enqueue(node)
  rear.next = node
  rear = node
```

**Dequeue O(1)**

```
Algorithm dequeue()
  temp = front
  front = front.next
  temp.next = null

  return temp
```

**Peek O(1)**

```
Algorithm peek()
  return front
```
