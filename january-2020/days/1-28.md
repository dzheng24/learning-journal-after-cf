My friends [Jo](https://github.com/jo-arroyo) and [Kyungrae](https://github.com/jeremymaya) helped me polishing up my resume today. Thank you guys so much!

Learning about WordPress 5, I'm watching this LinkedIn video on it. 

Terms to differentiate:
  - WordPress: A free, open-source web publishing application
    - "My new website is powered by WordPress."
  - WordPress.org: Official website for the WordPress project
  - WordPress.com: A hosting site for WordPress as a SaaS (software as a service) offering 

  WordPress works as an interface between you (content publisher), a database and server, and a visitor.

Today's code challenge, I started to work on that max subarray problem. With the help of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MmGzdiKR9Y&t=594s), I came up with the solution in cubic time. I will continue to work on this problem, with faster times. That video is super helpful. 

My code:
```js
var maxSubArray = function(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  let maxSubArraySum = Number.MIN_VALUE;

  for (let left = 0; left < n; left++) {
    for (let right = left; right < n; right++) {
      let windowSum = 0;
      for (let k = left; k <= right; k++) {
        windowSum += nums[k];
      }
      maxSubArraySum = Math.max(maxSubArraySum, windowSum)
    }
  }
  return maxSubArraySum;
}
```
