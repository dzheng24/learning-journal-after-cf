Visiting the library in Beacon Hill today. I like the wooden structures in here! I can totally skate to here when the weather gets better. 

Today I worked on a code challenge to validate parentheses.
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/


With the help of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Jq8Ibg2Ys) video, I used a Stack approach. Here's my code:
```js
function isValid(string) {
  let stack = new Stack();
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i ++) {
    if (string[i] === '(' || string[i] === '[' || string[i] === '{') {
      stack.push(string[i]);
    }
    else if (string[i] === ')' && stack.peek() === '(') {
      stack.pop();
    }
    else if (string[i] === ']' && stack.peek() === '[') {
      stack.pop();
    }
    else if (string[i] === '}' && stack.peek() === '{') {
      stack.pop();
    }
    else {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

## Reviewing Let and Const

This is the [file](../exercise/let-vs-const.js) I used to practice. 

Declaration vs. Initialization

```js
let b   // declaration

b = 10  // initialization

let d = 5 // declaration plus initialization in one step
```
- const cannot be declared only, you need to initialize it with declaration
- var and let can change their values; const cannot change its value 
- var can be accessible anywhere in function, but let and const can only be accessible inside the block where they are declared. 
- let and const have a block scope, but var has function scope 

- if var is defined outside the function, it has global scope so it can be accessed at anywhere
