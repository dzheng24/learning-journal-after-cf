## DevOps
https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support. 

DevOps can be interpreted as an outgrowth of Agile - agile software development prescribes close collaboration of customers, product management, developers, and sometimes QA to fill in the gaps and rapidly iterate towards a better product. 

DevOps is extending Agile principles beyond the boundaries of "the code" to the entire delivered service. 

## Machine Learning

Machine-learning algorithms are responsible for the vast majority of the artificial intelligence advancements and applications we hear about. 

Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive amounts of data. These include numbers, words, images, clicks... etc. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm. 


Today's code challenge was on converting a roman numero number to an integer. 
https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/

Here's my code: 
```js

function romanToInteger(string) {
  const translator = {};
  translator['I'] = 1;
  translator['V'] = 5;
  translator['X'] = 10;
  translator['L'] = 50;
  translator['C'] = 100;
  translator['D'] = 500;
  translator['M'] = 1000;

  if (string.length === 1) {
    return translator[string]
  }
  else {

    let result = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
      let current = translator[string[i]];
      // console.log(result, current, i, string.length);
      if (i + 1 < string.length) {

        let next = translator[string[i + 1]];

        if (current >= next) {

          result += current;

        }
        else {
          result += (next - current);
          i++;
        }
      }
      else {
        result += current;
      }
    }
    return result;
  }
}

```

A couple of takeaways from this challenge:
- Take my time when going code line by line
- Understand each line of code
- Make simple variable names for repeated and confusing code 

Hashset vs. Hashmap?
