Today I worked on the "max subarray" problem using a quadratic solution. Going from cubic to quadratic time, I'm taking baby steps; however, I feel I'm understanding nested for loops, and loops in general, a lot better. I'm looking forward to learn about "dynamic programming", and use that for my next step, so I can solve this problem in linear time. 

My code in quadratic time:
```js
function maxSubArray2 (nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  let maxSubArraySum = Number.MIN_VALUE;
  for (let left = 0; left < n; left++) {
    let windowSum = 0;
    for (let right = left; right < n; right++) {
      windowSum += nums[right];
      maxSubArraySum = Math.max(maxSubArraySum, windowSum);
    }
  }
  return maxSubArraySum;
}
```

Reviewing React

What is it?
  - A Javascript library for creating user interface

Where does React work?
  - Browser: ReactDOM
  - Server: ReactDOMServer
  - As a native app: React Native 

What is React good for?
  - Repeatable, reusable, UI elements
  - Display data that changes over time 
  - Apps and sites built entirely with JS

Babel: JS Transpiler
  - JSX -> JS
  - ES6 -> ES5

Webpack: JS bundler
  - Bundle JS files for use in a browser 

"React Concepts and Jargon"
  - React helps to visualize data 
  - React is **declarative**

  - State and props 
    - main ways to define and pass around data in react
  - one-way data flow 
    - "all down hill", parent to children
  - Virtual DOM
  - Synthetic events 

"Everything is Components and Elements"
  - Components are React building blocks
    - They are JS functions or classes 
    - Components should be reusable
    - Components are composed of elements.
