### Stack
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. 

Common stack terminologies:
1. Push - nodes that are put into the stack are _pushed_
2. Pop - nodes that are removed from the stack are _popped_.
3. Top - this is the top of the stack.
4. Peek - When you `peek`, you will view the `top` node in the stack.

Stack Concepts:
**FILO**: First In Last Out, the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack. 

**LIFO**: Last In First Out, the last item added tothe stack will be the first item popped out of the stack. 

Pushing a node onto a stack will always be an `O(1)` operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes you have in the stack.
