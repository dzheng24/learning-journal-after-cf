The solution to yesterday's code challenge, [search insert position problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/), seemed long, so I refactored it:

```js
function searchInsert2 (nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] >= target) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return nums.length;
}
```

I believe by continue to practice "visualize" the problem, look for certain patterns, will help me to write more clean and efficient code.

Today I learned a couple more tips to be a little faster on my keyboard:
  - To delete words after the cursor, hold down `control ^` key while pressing `D` key. 
  - Instead of swiping left or right on the trackpad, I can also combine the `control ^` key and the arrow keys.
