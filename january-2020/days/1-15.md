Today's code challenge is about removing duplicated values from an array, and return the length of that array. 

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/

Here's the code:
```js
function removeDuplicates(nums) {
  let index = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[i + 1]) {
      nums[index++] = nums[i + 1];
    }
  }
  return index;
}
```
