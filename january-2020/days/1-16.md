# 1/16/20 Thursday 

It's such a great learning environment at Code Fellows. Prior to Happy Hour today, I was getting ready to do  my code challenge; my friend John walked by, and ended up guiding me through the process. I learned a lot from him :)

Today's challenge is on "removing-element".

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/

```js
function removeElement(nums, val) {
  let counter = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] === val) {
      counter++;
    }
    else {
      nums[i] = nums[i - counter]
    }
  }
  return nums.length - counter;
}
```

I want to do this problem using the "splice method" approach next. 

It was great to see my old classmates on campus today. 

Today's code challenge reminds me to review these array methods:
  - split()
  - join()
  - slice()
  - splice()
