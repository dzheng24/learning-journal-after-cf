### "Full Stack is a Myth"
A full stack dev is somebody works in these four layers:
  - user experience
  - user interface
  - api/ action layer
  - data modeling

in between customer and business needs, and server, network, and hosting 

- building relationships is important; 
- build projects (contributing to open source software)
- passions? they really display your personality
- growth mindset
- build a portfolio site
