I'm at Squaw Valley in Lake Tahoe right now. My friends from Michigan are shredding the slopes :)

Watching a Web Development on LinkedIn Learning, 
  - This is a useful link to practice CSS:
    - [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)
  - Tool for improve your site's accessibility:
    - [Google's Light House Tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)


Some notes/review from watching the video:
  - Transpiler: converts newer JavaScript code to be compatible with older browsers 
  - Protocols: languages used to share information between devices 
    - Examples: POP, SMTP, IMAP, FTP
    - Most important ones to a developer:
      - HTTP/HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
        - GET: asks to receive some information
        - POST: sends some information
        - DELETE: asks to remove some information
      - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) / IP (Internet Protocol)
        - Information are broken down into little pieces called "packets"; that way, data can travel efficiently through the best possible path
        - How do the "packets" know where to go? That's where "IP" comes in. 
        - DNS (Domain Name Server): it transfers what you type in, like "google.com", into IP addresses.
        - HTTP Headers: important information that passes between client and server; think of them as the tags on the clothing you buy. **HTTP Headers** provides a lot of important information. 
  - Making web **accessible**
    - Accessibility Tree
    - Write HTML properly
    - ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications): further describes the role of each element.
