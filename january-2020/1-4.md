**What is a "Set"?**
A set lets you store values of unique type. 
  - a value in the set only occurs once 

```js
const set1 = new Set ([1,2,3,4,5])

console.log(set1.has(1))
//should return a boolean value
```


## Reviewing Data Structures: Trees

Trees are a data structure that have a "hierarchical" strucutre as opposed to linear strucutres like arrays or linked lists.

- "visualgo" is a helpful tool to use. 

- Level 0 is the very top level. 
- Height starts from count of 1. 

- Perfect Binary Tree 
  - nodes have either no children, or 2 children
  - the bottom layer of the tree is completely filled 
  - **the number of total nodes doubles as we go down one level of the tree**
  - **the number of total nodes on the bottom level, equal to the sum of all other nodes from other levels plus 1**


- Full Binary Tree
  - node has either 0 or 2 children, never just 1 child 


- Binary Search Tree
  - Loop Up: O(log n)
  - Insert: O(log n)
  - Delete: O(log n)

Today's code challenge:
Two sum problem with BST input.

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iv-input-is-a-bst/

```js
function TreeNode(val) {
  this.val = val;
  this.left = null;
  this.right = null;
}

function findTarget(root, k) {
  let stack = [root];
  // console.log('stack is ' + JSON.stringify(stack));
  let set = new Set();
  while (stack.length) {
    console.log('the length of stack is ' + stack.length)
    let node = stack.pop();
    console.log('the node value is ' + node.val)
    if (set.has(k - node.val)) {
      return true;
    }
    set.add(node.val);
    console.log('the set right now is ' + set.values())
    if (node.left) {
      stack.push(node.left);
    }
    if (node.right) {
      stack.push(node.right);
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```
