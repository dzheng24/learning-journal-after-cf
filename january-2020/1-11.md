I'm at the Seattle Public Library, Rainier Beach. Shout out to Dejounte Murray. I like the vibes of being at a library. 

Reviewing some basics before diving into the code challenge today. 

## Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions

Function Declarations in JavaScript:
  - The function statement declares a function. 
  - Just as Variable declations must start with "var", Function Declarations must begin with "function". 

Function Expression in JavaScript:
  - A JavaScript function can also be defined using an **expression**.
  - A function expression can be stored in a variable:
  ```js
  var x = function (a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }
  ```
  - After a function expression has been stored in a variable, the variable can be used as a function. Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked using the variable name. 

* **Function declarations** load before any code is executed while **Function expressions** load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code. 

Benefits of Function Expressions:
  - as closures
  - as arguments to other functions
  - as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
