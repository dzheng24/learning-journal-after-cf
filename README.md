# learning-journal-after-cf

## Welcome to my learning journal!

I graduated from Code Fellows, an awesome learning institution in Seattle, yesterday, after 5 months of learning how to code. It was a great experience! I gained valuable technical skills, and in the meantime met some amazing people who are so bright, kind, and dedicated to what they do. I'm very thankful for the collaboration experience there; working with people who have a growth mindset encourages me to constantly self-improve.

The learning continues on! I'm looking forward to study on my own (reviewing basic concepts, tackling code challenges, explore another programming language, etc.), as well as getting together with my friends and work on things together.

This journal will keep track of what I'm doing on a daily basis to become a better software developer.

Have a great day!

Update:

For the past two weeks, I've been a part of a Java project (TurboDuck), as well as diving back into front-end development. This journal will not be updated on a daily basis anymore. I started this journal the day after I graduated from Code Fellows, and about four months later, I was a SDE Apprentice at Amazon. I am very grateful for all the experiences, people I've met on this journey to learn programming. Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you have a great day.
