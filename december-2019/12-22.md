- Continuous Integration (CI) vs. Continuous Delivery (CD)
  * CI is process of regularly merging individual codes into a shared repository. Running unit and integration tests is a part of CI. 
  * CD is process of deploying software in short cycles, to ensure it's deployable at anytime. 

- Travis CI is a continuous integration service. Travis CI is configured by the `.travis.yml` file. 

- Example of `.travis.yml`:

```js
language: node_js
  node_js:
    - 'stable'
  script:
    - npm test
    - npm run lint
```
