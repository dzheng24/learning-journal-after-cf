# 12/21/19 Saturday

Today I started my learning journal. I plan to review some concepts from the beginning of my 401 course.

## Reviewing Class 1 Materials

- Difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`?
  * If the package needs an external package to run, that external package is listed under `dependencies`.
  * If the package is only needed in development, like a testing framework, then it is listed under `devDependencies`.

- Test Driven Development (TDD)
  * Methodology for writing code
  * 3 steps: red, green, refactor
    - red : writing tests first; when you run them, they should fail 
    - gren: write the code to pass the tests; when you run them, they should pass
    - refactor: refactor to make code run faster and more readable

- Run `npm run test-watch` in your project to continually test your code as you develop

```js
"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "lint": "eslint **/*.js",
    "test": "jest --verbose --coverage",
    "test-watch": "jest --watchAll --verbose --coverage"
  },
```

## A couple little things I learned/practiced today...
- A quick way to traverse in the same line on vsCode, is to use:
  - holding down `option` key and arrows keys
  - holding down `shift` key along with `option` can highlight the whole word
