Today I worked on a "number palindrome" code challenge. I learned how to validate a number without converting it to a string. This is the source I found: 
https://rishabh1403.com/leetcode-solution-of-palindrome-number-in-javascript

this is the code: 
```js
function isPalindromeTwo (num) {
  if (num < 0) {
    return false
  }
  let input = num;
  let reversed = 0;
  while (num > 0) {
    reversed = (reversed * 10) + (num % 10);
    console.log('reversed is ' + reversed)
    num = parseInt (num/10);
    console.log('num is ' + num)
  }
  if (reversed === input) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
It was interesting to see the "power of 10": 
  - By doing `12321 % 10`, this will give me the last digit of the number 
  - By doing `parseInt (12321 / 10)`, this will give me 1232.
