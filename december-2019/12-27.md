## Linked List Cycle 
- A cycle is when the linked list is no longer a linear structure; instead it cycles through a loop of nodes.

### How do I check for a cycle?
- Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm.
- This algorithm creates two pointers, one is slow, one is fast.
- If the two pointers ever meet, then it indicates that there is a cycle.
- Imagine I'm racing against Usain Bolt on a circular track, and he laps me.

```js
function hasCycle(list) {
  let turtle = list;
  let rabbit = list;
  while (rabbit && rabbit.next) {
    turtle = turtle.next;
    rabbit = rabbit.next.next;
    if (turtle === rabbit) {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```
