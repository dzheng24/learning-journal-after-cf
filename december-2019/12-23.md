going to LA today. doing some good while waiting at my gate :)

- Worked on writing some documentation for Squeakbot Earlier. I'm understanding better certain psql commands, such as `create database`, `drop database`, `psql -d [databse_name] -f schema.sql`, and just feel more comfortable with navigating the database. 

## Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/
- The four principles of OOP are **Encapsulation**, **Data Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.

- **Encapsulation** - each object keeps its state private; other objects don't have direct access to this state. 
- **Abstraction** - think of it as a natural exension of encapsulation. Each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.
  - "I don't have to know what goes under the hood of my phone when I press the home button."
- **Inheritance** - A way to reuse common logic, and extract unique logic in separate classes. 
  - We form a hierachy by creating a child class and parent class. 

- **Polymorphism** - this word means "many shapes" in Greek. 
  - This creates a way to use a class like its parent, but each child also keeps its own methods as they are.
