I'm reading "Eloquent JavaScript". Here are some notes.


## Intro
"When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep." -- Ursula K. Le Guin

- Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. 
- A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules. 
                
### What is JavaScript?
- Introduced in 1995, as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. 
- ES6 came out in 2015. 

## Chapter 1 Values, Types, and Operators
- The only thing living inside the computer's world, is data. 
- All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is fundamentally alike. 

-**Bits** are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones.
