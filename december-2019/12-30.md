We went to the Chinese Lantern Festival last night. On the drive there, my brother-in-law asked me some very good and basic questions. Such as:
  - "What is JavaScript"?
  - "What is the difference between JavaScript and languages like Java?"
  - "Why would you choose a programming language over another?"
  - "What is the difference between array and object?"
  - "What is recursion?"
