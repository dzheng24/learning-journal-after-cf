Worked on "two-sum" code challenge question today. Test is partially passing. This is what my code looks like at the moment. I will continue to work on it tomorrow. 

```js
function twoSum (nums, target) {
  const previousValues = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const currentValue = nums[i];
    const neededValue = target - currentValue;
    const index2 = previousValues[neededValue];
    if (index2) {
      return [index2, i];
    } else {
      previousValues[currentValue] = i;
    }
  }
}
``` 

This would work if the answer doesn't require the first index in the in the array.
For example:
twoSum([1,3,4,5], 4) would give me undefined;
twoSum([1,3,4,5], 9) would give me [2,3];

I will continue to work on this.
