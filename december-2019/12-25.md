Merry Christmas! I woke up at 5 morning, thinking alot about that two sum problem from last night. After putting in a lot of console logs, I played with the debugger tool. I finally found the problem: the index of "0" would make index2 a null value... this is my change! 

```js
if (index2 || index2 === 0) {
  return [index2, i];
```

I could've also just done it like this:

```js
if (index != null)
```

However I prefer the first version, it just seems more explicit to me. 

It felt really good to have found this bug! 

Also, my brother-in-law and I worked on a code challenge together today. It's on removing duplicated values in a sorted linked list. It was a lot of fun! 

```js
function deleteDuplicates (head) {
  let current = head;
  while (current.next !== null) {
    if (current.value !== current.next.value) {
      current = current.next
    } else {
      current.next = current.next.next;
    }
  }
  return head;
}
```
