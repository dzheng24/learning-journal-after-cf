Merry Christmas! I woke up at 5 morning, thinking alot about that two sum problem from last night. After putting in a lot of console logs, I played with the debugger tool. I finally found the problem: the index of "0" would make index2 a null value... this is my change! 

```js
if (index2 || index2 === 0) {
  return [index2, i];
```

I could've also just done it like this:

```js
if (index != 0)
```

However I prefer the first version, it just seems more explicit to me. 

It felt really good to have found this bug! 

Also, my brother-in-law and I worked on a code challenge together today. It's on removing duplicated values in a sorted linked list. It was a lot of fun!
