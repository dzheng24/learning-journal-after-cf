## Arrays
- lookup O(1)
- push O(1); can be O(n);
- pop O(1)
- unshift O(n): "realigning the indexes"
- insert O(n)
- delete O(n)

### Static vs. Dynamic Arrays 
- Static arrays are fixed in size
- Dynamic arrays allow us to copy and rebuilt an array in a new location (more memory)

Reviewed arrays today, and practiced javascript [class](../exercises/class-practice.js).
