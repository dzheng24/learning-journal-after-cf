Today I finished reviewing stacks and queues.  

https://github.com/dzheng24/warmup-dsa/tree/master/stacks-queues

## Stacks (can be implemented using arrays or linked lists)
"LIFO" - Last In First Out, think of them as a stack of plates

Pop: O(1);
Push O(1);
Peek O(1);
Lookup: O(n);

## Queues (best implemented with linked lists)
"FIFO" - FIFO, First In First Out, think of an entrance to a roller coaster

Enqueue: O(1);
Dequeue: O(1);
Peek: O(1);
Lookup: O(n);

## Together
Pros:
  - Fast Operations
  - Fast Peek
  - Ordered

Cons:
  - Slow Lookup
