I will likely not be moving onto the next step in the interview process. I was pretty disappointed to not get a response this afternoon, especially after refreshing my emails after 5 pm, 6pm... However, after some exercise, and positive thinking, I feel a lot better, and a lot fresher.

This is a snippet from my friend John's Thanksgiving post last year: 

Be thankful for the difficult times.

During those times you grow.

Be thankful for your limitations,

because they give you opportunities for improvement.

It's easy to be thankful for the good things, 

a life of rich fulfillment comes to those who are also thankful for the setbacks.

Gratitude can turn a negative into a positive,

find a way to be thankful for your troubles,

and they can become your blessings.
