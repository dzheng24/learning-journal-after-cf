## Reviewing some HTML and CSS 

**Block level** elements - elements that always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.

Examples of block elements are `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>`.

**Inline** elements - elements that will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. 

### Grouping Text & Elements in a Block

`<div>` - allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. 

### Grouping Text & Elements Inline 

`<span>` - acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>` element. The most common reason why people use `<span>` elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS. 

### CSS Selectors 
(a small table for a few that I always get mixed up)

| Selector      | Meaning | Example |
|-------------- | ------- | --------|
| Type Selector | Matches element names | `h1, h2, h3 {}` Targets the `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>` elements
| Class Selector | Matches an element whose `class` attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period symbol | `p.note {}` Targets only `<p>` elements whose `class` attribute has a value of `note` |
Child Selector | Matches an element that is a direct child of another | `li>a {}` Targets any `<a>` elements that are children of an `<li>` element (but not other `<a>` elements in the page) | 
Descendant Selector | Matches an element that is a descendent of another specified element(not just a direct child of that element) | `p a {}` Targets any `<a>` elements that sit inside a `<p>` element, even if there are other elements nested between them |
