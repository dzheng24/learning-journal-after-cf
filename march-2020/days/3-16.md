Continuing review about hashtables from yesterday...

## Hashtables are good at...
- fast lookup (good collision resolution needed)
- fast inserts
- flexible keys 

## Hashtables are bad at...
- unordered
- slow key iteration

Today I began reviewing linked lists, and I deployed the "my-blog" app via AWS EC2.
