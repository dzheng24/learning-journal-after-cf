## Reviewing How JavaScript Works...

"JavaScript is a single-threaded language that can be non-blocking."
  - Single-threaded: one callstack

What is a program?
  - Has to allocate memory
  - Parse and execute (read and run commands)

JavaScript Engine (V8 in Chrome)
  - Reads the JS and Change it into instructions for the browser
  - Consists of two parts 
    - Memory Heap
      - Where memory allocation happens 
      - Why we try to avoid global variables (unused variables may cause memory leak);
    - Call Stack
      - Where code is read and executed 

JavaScript Engine is part of the "JavaScript Run-Time Environment"
  - V8 Engine
  - Call Stack
  - Web API
    - DOM 
    - AJAX 
    - Timeout
  - Callback Queue
  - Event Loop
