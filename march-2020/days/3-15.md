Continuing review about arrays from yesterday...

## Arrays are good at...
- fast lookup, if you know the index; O(1)
- fast push/pop; O(1);
- ordered indexes (close to each other in memory);

## Arrays are bad at...
- slow inserts; O(n)
- slow deletes; O(n)
- fixed size (if using static array)

A couple array [practices](../exercises/array-practice.js) from today. 

Studied on hashtables in the afternoon. Check it out: https://github.com/dzheng24/warmup-dsa/tree/master/hash-table

Here's a little code challenge I did using hashmap/object: [practice](../exercises/hash-practice.js)
