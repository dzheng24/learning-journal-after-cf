Spent a long time trying to understand the code for insertion sort. I finally got it now :)

```js
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let current = arr[i];
    let j = i - 1;

    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > current) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = current;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Continued to work on the "my-blog" project. Got some good practice on refactoring today; DRY code (Don't Repeat Yourself). Up next on that project is finally connecting the front end and back end, should be fun!
