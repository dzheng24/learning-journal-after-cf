# 3/5/20 Thursday 

Today I worked on connecting the frontend and backend of the "my-blog" project. An important takeaway I got from today's learning is the "useEffect" hook. 

If I pass an empty `[]`, as the second a second argument, I am telling React to only run the effect only once; In my code, I have `[name]` as the second argument, this tells React to watch `name`, if it changes, then React will reapply the effect. 

```js
const ArticlePage = ({ match }) => {
  const name = match.params.name;
  const article = articleContent.find(article => article.name === name);

  const [articleInfo, setArticleInfo] = useState({ upvotes: 0, comments: [] });

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const result = await fetch(`/api/articles/${name}`);
      const body = await result.json();
      setArticleInfo(body);
      console.log(body);
    }
    fetchData();
  }, [name]);
```
