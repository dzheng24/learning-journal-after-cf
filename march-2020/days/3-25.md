Finished reviewing trees data structure today. Learned about other types of trees, including binary heap, which is associated with priority queues, and trie. 

## Heap (Binary Heap)
  - Lookup: O(n)
  - Insert: O(log n)
  - Delete: O(log n)
  - Great at doing comparative operations

  Pros:
    - Better than O(n)
    - Priority
    - Flexible Size
    - Fast Insert

  Cons:
    - Slow lookup

### Priority Queue
  - "Think of the emergency room example"

## Trie (Pre-fix Tree)
  - A specialized tree used in searching, most often with text
  - Usually has an empty root node 
  - Can have multiple children
  - **Searching for words in a dictionary, providing auto-completions**
  - Benefit: Speed and Space 
    - Time: O(length of word)
