Today I reviewed the trees data structure.

## Binary Tree 
  - Each node can only have 0, 1, or 2 nodes
  - Each child only has 1 parent 
  - Each node represents a certain state 

### Perfect Binary Tree vs. Full Binary Tree
  - Perfect binary tree has everything filled in - all the leaf nodes are full; a node either has 0 children or 2 children (very efficient)
    - Two important properties:
      - Number of nodes at each level doubles as it goes down the tree 
      - Sum of all nodes at the bottom level equals all the nodes above it plus 1
  - Full binary tree: a node either has either 0 or 2 children, but never just 1 child 

## Binary Search Tree
  - Great for comparing and searching
  - Preserves parent-child relationships
  - Lookup: O(log n);
  - Insert: O(log n);
  - Delete: O(log n);

  - Pros:
    - Better than O(n);
    - Ordered
    - Flexible Size 
  - Cons:
    - No O(1) operations 

## Balanced vs. Unbalanced Trees
 - Difference in depth greater than 1
 - We want balanced trees because of efficiency
