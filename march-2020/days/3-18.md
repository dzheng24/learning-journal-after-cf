I finished reviewing linked list today, and implemented a doubly linked list. It was nice to practice how to reverse a linked list.

```js
 reverse() {
    if (!this.head.next) {
      return this.head;
    }
    let first = this.head;
    this.tail = this.head;
    let second = first.next;
    while(second) {
      const temp = second.next;
      second.next = first;
      first = second;
      second = temp;
    }
    this.head.next = null;
    this.head = first;
    return this;
  }
```

Learned about git rebase. This article is a helpful source.
