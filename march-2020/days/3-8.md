# 3/8/20 Sunday 

I've been rewriting my resume the last few days, and it's finally finished :)

Hopefully the new resume will help me land my first job.

During my "warm-up" today, I was stuck on this problem for sometime :

```js
function reduce(arr, callback, result) {
  for (let i = 0 ; i < arr.length; i++) {
    result = callback(result, arr[i], i, arr);
  }
  return result;
}
const sum = reduce(numbers, (totalValue, currentValue) => {
  totalValue += currentValue;
  return totalValue;
}, 0)
```
