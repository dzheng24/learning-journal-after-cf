Today I finished practicing the CRUD API using Express from yesterday, got to use "handlebars" in the process. Also reviewed on recursion. I got to see and understand the callstack better by using the "debugger" in the Google Chrome's console. 

Here are a couple of examples: 
```js
let counter = 0; 
function inception() {
  debugger;
  console.log(counter);
  if (counter > 3) {
    return 'done!';
  }
  counter++;
  return inception();
}
```
```js
function findFactorialRecursive(number) {
  // base case 
  debugger;
  if (number === 2) {
    return 2;
  }
  return number * findFactorialRecursive(number - 1);
}
```
