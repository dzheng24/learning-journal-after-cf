Today I worked on the back-end of the "my-blog" react project. I got some good practice on MongoDB, and become familiar with different commands, such as `show dbs` or `show collections`. 

Here is a snippet of code, that shows how I connected the mongo database to the express server. 

```js
app.get('/api/articles/:name', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const articleName = req.params.name;
  
    const client = await MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017', {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true});
    const db = client.db('my-blog');
  
    const articleInfo = await db.collection('articles').findOne({ name: articleName});
    res.status(200).json(articleInfo);
  
    client.close();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'something went wrong', error});
  }
})
```
