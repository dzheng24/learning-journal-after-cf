5 tips for job hunting I learned today:
  - tailor your resume
  - reach out to companies that aren't hiring
  - network
  - treat job hunting like a job
  - follow up & stay organized

I am deploying the "my-blog" app on AWS. In the "front-end" react app repo, once I ran the `npm run build` command, I copied the "build" folder into the "src" directory of the "back-end" repo. Here are a few things added to the "server.js" file:

```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/build')));

//

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/build/index.html'))
})
```

And this might seem small, but it felt good when I added the "start" npm scripts to run `nodemon src/index.js`.
