Today we dug deeper into inheritance and composition, as well as strategy pattern. 

## Composition of Inheritance 
  - Delegation to a hierarchy

## Singleton Pattern 
  - Ensure a class has at most only one instance 
    - The instance may be *lazily initialized* (not until first requested)
  - Provides a global point of access to that instance 
    - Usually the class itself - via *static* method 
  - eager vs. lazy instantiation 
  - Private constructors ensure clients cannot create instances. 

### Examples that use eager initialization (when class loaded)
```java
public class Singleton {
  public static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
  private Singleton(){}       // prevent instantiation from outside
}

// this solution is better encapsulated, and generally preferable
public class Singleton {
  private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
  private Singleton(){}       // prevent instantiation from outside 
  public static Singleton getInstance() {
    return instance;
  }
}
```
## Inheritance and Composition
3 ways to get "HAS-A"
1. Direct Instantiation (worst of 3, because it's fixed)
2. Factory 
3. Dependency injection (best way)

```java
public void learnStudentNames(Collection<String> names){
  // code to the interface, not the implementation
  // you would never take in ArrayList<String>
}
