Today I was in Jay's tutoring session. We reviewed on Interfaces and exceptions. It was incredibly helpful; it cleared up a lot of my confusions, especially on checked and unchecked exceptions. 

For unchecked exceptions, you don't have to "announce it", which gives an element of surprise, and that you don't have to `catch` it.

For checked exceptions, you have to "announce it", meaning give out that `throws` clause, and you also have to `catch` it.
