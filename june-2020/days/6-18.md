"Threads are like children: easy to create them, hard to control them."

## Class Notes 

### Review from Yesterday
- .filter() takes in a predicate <T in, boolean out>, returns a stream
- .sorted() takes in a comparator, returns a stream
  - T in, R out; T in, sort key out 
  - .sorted(Comparator.comparing(emp -> emp.getSalary()))
- .peek() takes in consumer, returns a stream
- `.collect(Collectors.toList())`, returns a list 

## Threading and Concurrency 
- Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently within a single process. 
- A thread is a single sequential flow of control w/in a process. 

- All code in Java is executed by a thread. 

```java
class Kitchen {
  private Toaster toast;
  private Fridge fridge;
  private Microwave micro;
  private CoffeeMaker coffeeMachine;

  public void takeItemFromFridge() { 
    synchronized(fridge) {

    }
  } 

  public void makeCoffee() {
    synchronized(coffeeMachine) {

    }
  }

  public void nukeSomeFood() {
    synchronized(micro) {

    }
  }

  public void makeToast() {
    synchronized (toaster) {
      
    }
  }
}
