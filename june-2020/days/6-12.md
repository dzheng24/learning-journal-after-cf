## Class Notes 

  - True or false: Type-safe collections re useful when you have a collection of just one type, but this is a rare situation.
    - False; it is not rare, it IS the situation. 

  - True or false: You can create a new collection from an existing collection.
    - True

  - Which collection acts like a table of key-value pairs?
    - Map

  - In which collections are duplicates disallowed? How is "duplicate" determined?
    - Set, equals method 

```java

Map<K,V>

Map<String, Student>

// There are different maps for different purposes. 
```


Wildcard syntax

addAll example:
- `addAll()`
- `boolean addAll(Collections<? extends E> c)`

```java
// The E is always some real type 
Collection<Employee> employees = ... // What's the <E> -> Employee

employees.add(new Employee("Jay", "1990-08-24"));
employees.add(new Employee("John", "2000-01-01"));
employees.add(new Employee("Annie", "1992-02-03"));

// using the "addAll" method example 


Collection<SalariedEmployee> salarieds = ... // What's the <E> -> SaslariedEmployee

employees.add(new SalariedEmployee("Jay", "1990-08-24"), 45000.0);
employees.add(new SalariedEmployee("John", "2000-01-01"), 55000.0);
employees.add(new SalariedEmployee("Annie", "1992-02-03"), 65000.0);

employees.addAll(salarieds); // what's going on here? 
```

Given : Collection<Employee>

and: SalriedEmployee IS-A Employee

is Collection<SalariedEmployee> a SUBCLASS of Collection<Employee> ? 
    **NO**

```java
public class Portfolio <T extends Security> // T can be anything as long as it extends Security, it can't be String, Child, or WashingMachine

<? extends Security> // can be anything as long as it's security. What's the difference?

```java
Collection<String> names = ...

for(String name : names) {
  // print it 
}

Collection<Apple> apples = ...

for(Apple apple : apples) {
  // take a bite
}
Collection<Candle> candles = ...

for(Candle candle : candles) {
  // blow it out 
}
```
Design Patterns - Catalog of **Experience** 

Singleton Pattern
  - Ensure a class has at most only one instance 

```java
public class Singleton {
  public static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

  private Singleton() {

  } // prevent instantiation from outside 
}

// below is better
public class Singleton {
  private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();

  private Singleton() {} // prevent instantion from outside

  public static Singleton getInstance() {
    return instance;
  }
}
