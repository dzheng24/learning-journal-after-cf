## Weekend Review 
Reading "Collections Overview" Again 

- The Java Collections Framework is all about storing and manipulating groups of objects. 

- Any type of object can be stored as an **element** in a collection.
  - What do we mean by "object"? 
    - use *generics*, signifeid by **type parameter E**. 

### Generics and Type-Safe Collections 
- Generics add **type safety** to collections 
```java
// pronounced "collection of Fruit"
Collection<Fruit> apples = new ArrayList<Fruit>();
```
Collection of objects are NOT recommended.
