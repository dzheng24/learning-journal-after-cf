## Class Notes 

- "Commonality and Variance"
- "Find what varies, and encapsulate it"
- "Have the conversation, all software starts with conversation."
- Extracting business rules from conversation is an art form. What kind of notes do I take? 
- Look for "nouns"; circle the nouns, underline the verbs. 

```java
com.entertainment;

public class Television {

}

class Tuner {

}

----------------- // package boundary 

com.entertainment.client;

public class TelevisionClient {
  // TelevisionClient only sees Television
}

public class TunerTest {
  // can't see tuner 
}
```

Today we started to practice with JUnit. From doing the homework, I need to review on Comparable vs. Comparator.
