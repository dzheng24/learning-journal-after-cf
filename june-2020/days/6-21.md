On Friday, we started to plan for our Java project. 

## Following along Chapter 6 in Head First Java: Get to Know the Java API: Using the Java Library 

- Even though an array is an object, it lives in its own special world and you can't invoke any methods on it, although you can access its one and only instance variable, _length_. 

- To use a class from the API, somewhere in the code, you have to indicate the *full* name of the library class you want to use. "package name + class name."

- Packages are important for 3 main reasons:
  - Organization
  - Name scoping (prevent collisions if there are classes with the same name)
  - Security (access control)
