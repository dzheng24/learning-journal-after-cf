## Weekend Review 

Popular implementations of `Set` include: 
  - `HashSet`(most popular, no guarantee about the order of its elements)
  - `LinkedHashSet`(stores them in the order in which they were added)
  - `TreeSet`(implements `SortedSet`, stores them in natural order)

Popular implementations of `Map` include: 
  - `HashMap`(most popular)
  - `LinkedHashMap`(maintains "add order")
  - `TreeMap`(implements `SortedMap`)
  - `Hashtable`(legacy from Java 1.0)

### Autoboxing with Collections 

  - Collections can only store class types(not primitives)
  - Autoboxing eliminates the manual conversion between primitive types and wrapper types
    - It's still of a `Collection<Integer>`
    - But you can work with it as if it were a collection of `ints`
  ```java
  List<Integer> ages = new ArrayList<>();
  ages.add(2);            // autoboxed to Integer(2)
  ages.add(3);            // autoboxed to Integer(3)

  int age = ages.get(0);  // autounboxed to int 2 
  ```
