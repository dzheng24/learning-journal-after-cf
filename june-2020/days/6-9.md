## Class Notes 
- Static fields are common, or **shared** among instances 
  - They are not stored in each instance, but in a class-wide area 
- Static methods do not execute inside instances. 

**STATIC = SHARE**

  - Enums can be safely compared by using `==`. 

## Exceptions 
- Exceptions are used to indicate and handle "errors". 
  - If a method can't complete its task, it `throws` an exception

  - Checked: compiler forces you to deal with it (in several ways)
  - Unchecked: compiler leaves this up to you 

**A superclass constructor is always called, ALWAYS**
