  "for each loops are so 2016!" 
    - use `forEach()` instead. 


There were a lot of materials taught to us today: 
  
  - lambda expressions: they are there to encapsulate a single unit of behavior
  - functional interface: an interface that only has one abstract method 
   method references
   **Anywhere a functional interface type is expected, a "compatible" lambda can be used
  - method references: shorthand notation for certain lambda forms 
  - Streams!


## Class Notes 
- After we added the @Fast annotation to our Employee class, it didn't actually run faster. Why not?
  - We didn't write any reflection; annotations by themselves do nothing, it's up to the run time to READ the annotations

- Explain the "special relationship" between an inner object and its containing object.
  - Inner object can not exist on its own
  - They can see each others' privates 

- List some reasons why inner classes are used. 
  - Maintain encapsulation
  - Less top level classes

- Shortcut syntax available with annotation's 'value' attribute
  ```java
  @Fast(0.25)  or @Fast(value=0.25)
  @Fast(value=0.25, verbose=true) // now you can't use the shortcut 
  ```

## Lambda Expressions 
(params) -> body
```java
public class TelevisionChannelComparator implements Comparator<Television> {
  public int compare(Television tv1, Television tv2) {
    return tv1.getCurrentChannel() - tv2.getCurrentChanel();
  }
}
// what would lambda look like?
// value is implicitly returned
// return statement not allowed
(tv1,  tv2) -> tv1.getCurrentChannel() - tv2.getCurrentChannel();

```

java.util.function has a new set of Functional Interfaces 

---

Consumer<T> : a method that takes in an object, and doesn't return anything 
  - T in, nothing out 


---

Predicate<T>
  function descriptor:  T -> boolean "T in -> boolean out"
  purpose: make a "keep it or toss it" decision 

Predicate<Television>
  Television -> boolean 

// API for removeIf()
tvList.removeIf(Predicate<T>)    List<Television> means the "T" is Television
tvList.removeIf(Predicate<Television>)

// this is how you call it w/ a lambda for the Predicate
```java
tvList.removeIf(tv -> tv.getBrand().equals("Sony"))
tvList.removeIf(tv -> tv.getCurrentChannel() <= 9)
```
