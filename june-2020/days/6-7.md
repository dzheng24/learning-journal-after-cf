Today I finished my Code Review Project. 

## Head First Java Chapter 6: Get to Know the Java API: Using the Java Library 

The core Java library is a giant pile of classes just waiting for you to use like building blocks, to assemble your own program out of largely pre-built code. 

_ArrayList_, a class in the core Java library. (The API)

```java
ArrayList <Egg> myList = new ArrayList<Egg>();
```

### Comparing ArrayList to a regular array
1. A plain old array has to know its size at the when it's created. 
  - The ArrayList does not need to know how big it should be, because it grows and shrinks as objects are added or removed. 

2. To put an object in a regular array, you must assign it to a specific location. 
  - With ArrayList, you can use the `add()` method; the ArrayList will keep growing to make room for the new thing. 

3. Arrays use array syntax that's not used anywhere else in Java. 
  - ArrayLists are plain old Java objects. No special syntax. 

4. ArrayLists in Java 5.0 are parameterized. 
    ```java
    ArrayList <Dog> // Dogs is a type parameter, "a list of dogs"
    ```
