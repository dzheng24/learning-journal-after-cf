Today I spent a lot of time practicing react. I finished the first project of the linked-in react tutorial, and I started on the second one today. 

## Form Components
Controlled or uncontrolled 

Who is the "Source of Truth" for form data?

**Controlled Components**
- React is the source of truth (react state)
- Your code controls whether the form value changes 
- Every piece of state works the same way
- Recommended by react docs
- Disadvantage: more code 

**Uncontrolled Components**
- More familiar: the DOM is the source of truth
- Advantage: a bit less code to write
- Can be easier when porting existing sites to React
- You can't enforce field values easily 
- Could be confusing about who owns what
