# 2/20/20 Thursday

Today I started a new full stack app, using react.

I learned an important Git command: 

`git branch -u origin/master`

This command will tell the local branch to compare itself to the remote branch. This is useful when we initiate the repo locally first, instead of cloning it from the remote repo.
