## Identify Where State Should Live 

For each piece of state in the application:
  - Identify every component that renders something based on that state 
  - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy)
  - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state
  - If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component
