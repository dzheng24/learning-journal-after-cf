Today I practiced promise and async await, while fetching from the starwars API. 

Reading:

"Thinking in React"

https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html

## To make user interface interactive, React achieves this through `state`. 

Ask these three questions to determine if a data is a state:
  - Is it passed in from a parent via props? (If so, it probably isn't a state)
  - Does it remain unchanged over time? (If so, it probably isn't a state)
  - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? (If so, it isn't a state)

I will continue this reading tomorrow.
