## Hoisting 
```js
// code before hoisting (how a programmer wrote the code)
var chars = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
var result = upperCharList(chars);
console.log(result);

function upperCharList(list){
  var result = [];
  for(var i=0; i<list.length; i++){
    var upper = list[i].toUpperCase());
    result.push(upper);
  }
  return result;
}

// after hoisting (how the code actually runs)
var chars, result;
function upperCharList(list){
  var result, i, upper;
  result = [];
  for(i=0; i<list.length; i++){
    upper = list[i].toUpperCase();
    result.push(upper);
  }
  return result;
}

chars = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
result = upperCharList(chars);
console.log(result)
```

## The Call Stack
- In JS, each synchronous function that is called is pushed onto a stack in V8. This is the **Call Stack**.
- The function on top of the stack is always the function that is currently executing. 
- When the function that is running returns, it is "popped" off a stack. 

## The Callback Queue
- If a function makes an external API call, once the external API has completed its task, it will pass any results into the callback and enqueue the callback on V8's **callback queue**. Functions stored on the callback queue are not executing, they are only **waiting** to be put onto the callstack. 

## The Event Loop
- The event loop is in charge of dequeueing callbacks from the callback queue and pushthem onto the callstack. The event loop will only push a callback onto the callstack if it is empty. 

  When the call stack pops its last function:
    - the event loop will check if any callbacks are in the callback queue
    - if it finds a callback it will dequeue it from the callback queue and push it onto the call stack
