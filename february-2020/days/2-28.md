Reading: JavaScript's Reduce Method 

https://medium.com/nona-web/understanding-javascript-reduce-and-its-use-cases-49a89d3aaa80


The reduce method takes in 2 parameters.

First - a callback function that takes up to 4 parameters (all optional)
  1. `previousValue`
  2. `currentValue`
  3. `currentIndex`
  4. `array`

Second - is the `initialValue`, this sets the `previousValue` used in the first iteration. 

The single use case of for the "reduce" function is to create clusters of data. 

Here's my [practice](../exercises/reduce-practice.js) so far. I will continue tomorrow.
