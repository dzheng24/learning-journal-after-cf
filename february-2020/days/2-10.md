Continued to work on my portfolio today.

I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoRJizFvM7s) to be a nice review of callbacks, promises, and async await. I also practiced some `promise.all` in the [exercise](../exercises/promises.js) file.

Today I learned that "fetch API" does not work in the Node environment, an environment like the web browser would support it.
