Today I worked on the "length of last word" problem. Through this problem, I learned about the "trim" method, which removes the white space on either side of a string. 

Here's my code:
```js
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
  if (s === null) {
    return null;
  }
  let length = 0;
  s = s.trim();
  for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (s[i] === ' ') {
      break;
    }
    length++;
  }
  return length;
};
```
