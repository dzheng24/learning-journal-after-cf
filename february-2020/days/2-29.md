Learned more, and [practiced](../exercises/reduce-practice.js) more on Reduce method today. 

Reduce method is a great way to do data manipulation, it makes large sets of data more easily for us to interpret. 

```js
// multiple cluster: date categorization 
// Say you have a list of a usersâ€™ transactions with Unix timestamps and you wanted to group them by month (so a user could open one month, and close the others for better UX)

const transactions = [
  { timestamp: 1546681958000, amount: 400},
  { timestamp: 1542271921000, amount: -200},
  { timestamp: 1549188947000, amount: 500},
  { timestamp: 1541982961000, amount: 660},
  { timestamp: 1542811972000, amount: 431},
  { timestamp: 1543151943000, amount: -500},
  { timestamp: 1548581618000, amount: -1200},
]

transactions.sort((a, b) => (b - a)) // this sets them in a descending order 

const monthlyTransactions = transactions.reduce((transactionGroup, transaction) => {
  const date = new Date(transaction.timestamp);
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = `${date.toLocaleString('en-us', {month: 'long'})} ${year}`

  transactionGroup[month] = (transactionGroup[month] || []); // this initializes array if it doesn't exist
  transactionGroup[month].push(transaction.amount); // push transaction amount to current month 
  return transactionGroup;
}, {})

console.log(monthlyTransactions);
```
