## Michelle's Talk on Heaps 

- Each DS has advantages and disadvantages (space and time complexity)

- Arrays?
  - get things at index
  - bad at? change size

- linked list?
  - good at iterating, adding things
  - bad at getting things at certain index

- Hashmaps?
  - looking things up
  - take more space than other things
  - not ordered
  
- BST?
  - good at searching!

- Trees?
  - good at maintaing hierarchy 


Heap: (priority queues)
  - insert data
  - get maximum/minimum of all added data 
    - remove max 

"heaps are a fansy tree", the root is the maximum value; 
  - a tree where each node's value is greater both children, and complete
  - think of them as trees, but write them as arrays 

add: O(h) -> O(lg(n))
  - add new node at right spot
  - bubble it up

remove max: O(h) -> O(lg(n))
