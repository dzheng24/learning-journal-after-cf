Today's challenge is called "plus-one". After getting stuck on this problem for a while, I took my dog out for a walk. It helped me clear my head, and take a different approach. 

My code:
```js
var plusOne = function(digits) {
  for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (digits[i] < 9) {
      digits[i]++;
      return digits;
    }
    else {
      digits[i] = 0
    }
  }

  digits.unshift(1);
  return digits;
}
```
One takeaway I got from doing this challenge is that:
  - think about the edge cases can help organize your thought process better
