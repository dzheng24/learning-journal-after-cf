# 2/23/20 Sunday 

Home in Yelm this weekend. Last night, my family and I watched the Wilder-Fury fight. It was brutal to watch, as I was rooting for Deontay. He showed a lot of heart; and he was so respectful and classy after being knocked out. 

Deontay Wilder last night reminded me to handle losses like a champ.
