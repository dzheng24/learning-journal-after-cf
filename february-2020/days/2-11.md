## Installing and Running Wordpress using MAMP

What is MAMP?
  - Installs a "AMP" stack on your computer
  - Apache: a web server application
  - MySQL: relational database 
  - PHP: scripting language 
  - These work together to create a web host on your computer 

WordPress needs two discrete components to work:
  - It needs a web server (we achieve this through MAMP, shout out to Apache)
  - And a DB (MySQL)


I set up WordPress on my computer today, and this afternoon I finished my portfolio site. It's here:
