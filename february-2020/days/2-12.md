# 2/12/20 Wednesday 

I started on the third project of my react tutorial today. 

In react, 
  - with class components, we use life cycle methods. "Mounting" and "Unmounting". 
  - with hooks and functional components, it uses `React.useEffect()` hook. 


Tonight, my friend [Kyungrae](https://github.com/jeremymaya) and I went to Seattle DevOps Meetup at Chef Inc.

## Using CI/CD Pipelines w/ AWS CloudFormation
Luis Colon, Dev Advocate, AWS CloudFormation

- Code(write templates in YAML, or JSON) -> 
- Commit(Upload templates directly via browser, from an S3 bucket...) -> 
- Execute(Create stacks from templates using the console, CLI, or AWS SDK...) -> 
- Deploy(stacks, stack sets, and resources are created, updated, and managed in a uniform way)

Pipelines

  Development **(should be fast)**
    - works on smallest thing possible
    - only local code branches
    - develops and tests locally
    - explicitly defines dependencies
    - publishes changes for review 

  Mid Stage(s) **(should be thorough)**
    - Builds and runs unit testing
    - Bundles code and run-time dependencies into a combined artifact
    - Providence of dependencies tracked 

  Production **(looking for any reason to fail)**
    - "Only promote on success, test failures rollback, bake failures stop"
    Beta -> Gamma -> Production

"Headless Linting" 

"Taskcat for Sandbox Integration Testing" 

Best Practices
  - Small changes to small components
    - Templates, stacks, resources
    - Broken by lifecycle
  - Large deployments
    - Immutable vs upgrade in place
    - Blue/Green and Canaries
    - Break large fleets into waves 
    - Instrument pipelines for observability

"Lift and Shift"(In-House) vs. Cloud Native 

Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)

"Pop Corn Example" 

Containers - Lightweight Linux Isolation 

Container Registries
  - Convenient and Efficient packaging 
  - Same great flavor every time

Container Orchestration - Kubernetes
  - Delicious Fresh-popped popcorn 

Serverless / Functions as a Service
  - Pre-popped, pre-candied, and pre-packaged 

Service Mesh 
  - Multiple flavors on one stick 

Terraform - Infrastructure as code
