## Map and Set in JavaScript 

https://www.taniarascia.com/understanding-map-and-set-javascript/

The two main data structures for storing data are Objects and Arrays. We use Objects to store key/value pairs, and arrays to store indexed lists. 

ES6 introduces two new types of iterable objects:
  - Maps: ordered collections of key/value pairs 
  - Sets: collections of unique values 

**Map**

A map is a collection of key/value pairs that can use any data type as a key and maintain the order of its entries.

Maps can be initialized with the `new Map()` syntax.

You can add values to a map with the `set()` method. The first argument will be the key, and the second argument will be the value. 

Maps accept any data type as a key, and do not allow duplicate key values. 

**When to Use Map**
Maps have several advantages over objects
- Size: maps have a `size` property, whereas Objects do not have a built-in way to retrieve their size
- Iteration: maps are directly iterable, where objects are not 
- Flexibility: maps can have any dta type (primitive or Object) as the key to a value, while objects can only have strings
- Ordered: maps retain their insertion order, whereas objects do not have a guaranteed order
