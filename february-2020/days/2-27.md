Since I've started to do these "warmup exercises", such as practicing object destructuring, setting up express server, I'm beginning to feel more and more comfortable. I noticed this as I was working on my react app today. 

Today I finished the frontend aspect of the ["my-blog"](https://github.com/dzheng24/my-blog) react project, and started to build the backend.
