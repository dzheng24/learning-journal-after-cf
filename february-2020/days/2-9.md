# 2/9/20 Sunday 

Today I went to a Seattle JS meet up at KEXP. It was a fun time, I got to meet some nice people and also got to work on my portfolio there. I also met somebody who went to my high school! Small world haha. 

It was a beautiful day in Seattle, besides working on my portfolio, I also got to skateboard finally!

Tonight I practiced promises functions; I understand them better now. [My Practice](../exercises/promises.js)
