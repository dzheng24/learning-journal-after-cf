# 5/10/20 Sunday 

Continuing from yesterday's challenge, today I did the "bonus challenge", which is to make "24" appear after 3 "hellos" instead of "10". One thing I am unsure of is the line `Echo e2 = e1`, the value of `e1.count` is updated with the value of `e2.count` during each iteration. 

```java
public class EchoTestDrive {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
    Echo e1 = new Echo();
    Echo e2 = e1;
    int x = 0;
    while (x < 4) {
      System.out.println("x is at " + x);
      e1.hello();
      e1.count = e1.count + 1;
      System.out.println("e1 count is " + e1.count);
      if (x == 3) {
        e2.count = e2.count + 1;
      }
      if (x > 0) {
        System.out.println("before the condition: " + e2.count);
        e2.count = e2.count + e1.count;
      }
      x = x + 1;
      System.out.println("e2 count at the end of loop is " + e2.count);
    }
    System.out.println(e2.count);
  }
}

class Echo {
  int count = 0;
  void hello() {
    System.out.println("Helloooo... ");
  }
}
```

### Two Declaration Rules:
- Variables must have a type.
- Variables must have a name. 

**A variable is just a cup. A container. It _holds_ something.**
