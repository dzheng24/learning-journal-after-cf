## Preparing for 1st day of Class!

### What is Java? 
1. A programming language - strongly typed, object-oriented, general purpose language 
2. A runtime system - The JVM translates Javas bytecode (output from the compiler) to native operating system code at runtime 
3. A platform
  - **JDK** (Java Development Kit) contains the JVM + other runtime facilities
  - JDK is available for many operating systems 
  - It includes the Java API, with many standard classes 

Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle) was Java's inventor. 

### Java is Dynamic - The Runtime Process 
Several phases take place at runtime
1. Java Bytecode - includes symbolic reference information from the compiler 
2. Java Class Loader - loads bytecode into memory 
3. Java Verifier - confirms that bytecodes are valid and follow security rules 
4. Java Interpreter - translates bytecode into native code and performs final name resolution 

### Java Development Kit (JDK)
The Java Development Kit provides all basic components for Java programming 

Major components include:
  - The Java core API libraries 
  - Command line tools 

### Java API 
Organized into **packages**(related libraries)

### What is an Object?
- A software representation containing **data** and **behavior**. 
- It's a recommended practice that users of an object only interact with the object's **behavior**.
