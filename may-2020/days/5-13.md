```java
b = c;
```
The above line means assign the values of variable _c_ to variable _b_. 

```java
c = null;
```
The above line assigns the value `null` to variable **c**. This makes **c** a _null reference_, meaning it doesn't refer to anything. But it's still a reference variable, and another object can still be assigned to it. 

### An array is like a tray of cups 
1. Declare an int array variable. An array variable is a remote control to an array object. 
```java
int[] nums;
```

2. Create a new int array with a length of 7, and assign it to the previously-declared `int[]` variable `nums`.
```java
nums = new int[7];
```

3. Give each element in the array an int value. Elements in an int _array_ are just int _variables_. 
```java
nums[0] = 6;
// and so on
```

### Arrays are always objects, whether they're declared to hold primitives or object references.
