## Chapter 4 Continues...

### You can send things to a method

**A method _uses_ parameters. A caller _passes_ arguments.**

**If a method takes a parameter, you _must_ pass it something.** And that something must be a value of the appropriate type. 

### You can get things _back_ from a method

Methods can return values. Every method is declared with a return type, but until now we've made all of our methods with a **void** return type, which means they don't give anything back. Like this:
```java
void go() {

}
```

We can declare a method to give a specific type of value back to the caller, like this:
```java
int theSecret = life.giveSecret();

int giveSecret() {
  return 42;
}
```
Note: The bits representing 42 are returned from the giveSecret() method, and land in the variable named _theSecret_.

If you declare a method to return a value, you _must_ return a value of the declared type. 

**Java is pass-by-_value_. That means pass-by-_copy_.**
