## Reading in "Introduction to Java"

### Static Fields and Methods 
- A `static` or _class_ field is associated with a class 
  - Often used to define class **constants**, generally **public**

- Only **one copy** of a static field exists
  - Independent of instances, shared by all users 
  - Can be accessed without an instance 

- `static` **methods** can be invoked **without an instance** 

### Session 3 Summary 
- **Overloaded** methods let you give **methods the same name**
  - must have different parameter lists 

- Encapsulation hides a type's implementation 

- **Constructors** are methods called when an object is created 
  - Supports object initialization
  - Have the same name as the class, and no return value 

- **Static** or class field or methods are associated with a **class**
  - Static methods **cannot** access regular fields, only static fields
