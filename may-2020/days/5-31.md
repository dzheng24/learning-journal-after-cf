Finally figured out why `SimpleDotCom.java` couldn't save as a Java file. I had to do a little digging under Preferences => Editor => File Types... Thanks to all of my friends, especially Brad, Dan, and Jeff for taking a look with me. 

## Continuing with Chapter 5 in Head First Java 

### Prepping for the SimpleDotComGame class 
**The SimpleDotComGame needs to do this:**
  1. Make the single SimpleDotCom Object
  2. Make a location fo it (3 consecutive cells on a single row of 7 virtual cells)
  3. Ask the user for a guess
  4. Check the guess 
  5. Repeat until the dot com is dead 
  6. Tell the user how many guesses it took 

"When you write prepcode, you should assume that somehow you'll be able to do whatever you need to do, so you can put all your brainpower into working out the logic".  

### Important Points 
  - Your Java program should start with a high-level design
  - Typically you'll write 3 things when you create a new class
    - prepcode 
    - testcode 
    - real(Java) code 
  - Prepcode should describe _what_ to do, not _how_ to do it
  - Use the prepcode to help design the test code
  - Write test code _before_ you implement the methods 
  - Choose _for_ over _while_ when you know how many times you wnt to repeat the loop code 
  - Use `Integer.parseInt()` to get the int value of a string 
  - Use _break_ to leave a loop early 

### Pre and Post Increment/Decrement Operator 
  - Putting the operator _before_ the variable, like `++x` means, "first, increment x by 1, and _then_ use this new value of x." This only matters when the `++x` is part of some larger expression rather than just in a single statement. 

  ```java 
  int x = 0; int z = ++x;
  // produces: x = 1, z = 1

  int x = 0; int z = x++;
  // produces: x is 1, but z is 0; z gets the value of x, and then x is incremented 
  ```

### Enhanced for loop
  ```java
  for (String name : nameArray) {}
  ```
  The above snippet means: "For each element in nameArray, assign the element to the 'name' variable, and run the body of the loop." 

  **How the compiler sees it**:
    - Create a String variable called _name_ and set it to null
    - Assign the first value in _nameArray_ to name
    - Run the body of the loop
    - Assign the next value in _nameArray_ to name
    - Repeat while _there are still elements in the array

### Casting primitives 

  - You can't shove a big thing directly into a small thing.
  ```java
  long y = 42;
  int x = y; // won't compile, because a long is bigger than an int
  ```
  - To force the compiler to jam the value of a bigger primitive variable into a smaller one, you can use the **cast** operator:
  ```java
  long y = 42;
  int x = (int) y;

### Crossword Puzzle 

  - Fancy computer word for build: implement
  - Multi-part loop: for
  - Test first: extreme
  - 32 bits: int
  - Method's answer: return 
  - Prepcode-esque: pseudocode
  - Change: cast 
  - The big toolkit: API
  - An array unit: element
  - Instance or local: variable 
  - Automatic toolkit: java.lang
  - Looks like a primitive, but...: Integer
  - Un-castable: boolean
  - Math method: random 
  - Converter method: parseint
  - Leave early: break
  - Increment type: pre
  - Class's workhorse: method
  - Pre is a type of: operator 
  - For's iteration: expression
  - Establish first value: initialize
  - while or for: loop
  - Update an instance variable: set 
  - Towards blastoff: decrement 
  - A cycle: iteration 
  - Talkative package: java.io
  - Method messenger(abbreviation): arg
  - As if: virtual
  - Add after: post 
  - Pi house: Math 
  - Compile it and: run 
  - ++ quantity: one
