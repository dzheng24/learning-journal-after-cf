### Primitive Types
- boolean
- char
- byte 
- short
- int
- long 
- float
- double 

Mnemonic for remembering them:
"Be Careful! Bears Shouldn't Ingest Large Furry Dogs"

### Controlling your object 
- There is actualluy no such thing as an object variable.
- There's only an object reference variable.
- An object reference variable holds bits that represent a way to _access_ an object.
- It doesn't hold the object itself, but it holds something like a pointer. 

Although a primitive variable is full of bits representing the actual **value** of the variable, an object reference variable is full of bits representing **a way to get to the object**.

You use the dot operator on a reference variable to say, "use the thing _before_ the dot to get me the thing _after_ the dot."
`myDog.bark()` means: "use the object referenced by the variable myDog to invoke the bark() method." 

When you use the dot operator on an object reference variable, think of it like pressing a button on the remote control for that object. 


With primitive variables, the value of the variable is ... the _value_.

With reference variables, the value of the variable is ... _bits representing a way to get to a specific object_.
