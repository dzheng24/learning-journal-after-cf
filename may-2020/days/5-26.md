## Class Notes 

  - Always use `.equals()` when comparing objects. 
  
  - Use `==` to compare references/addresses.

  For loop: 3 pieces
  For-each loop: 2 pieces separated by colon

  ```java
  int[] numbers = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
  for (int n : numbers) {
    System.out.println("n = " + n);
  }
  ```

## Session 5: More on Classes and Objects 
  - Objectives 
    - Understand and use enum types 
    - Understand and use wrapper classes for primitive values 
    - Learn and use Java's data/time support 
    - Be more familiar with how object references work 
  
### Type-Safe Enums 
  - [helpful-link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYKHxwQ0QH8&t=359s)
  - Enums do not have types, it's just a list of labels
  - Why we use it?
    - We use it for things that do not change 
  - Under the hood, an enum gets compiled into a class 
  - Use `ordinal()` to get a numerical value
  - Use `valueOf()` to convert a string to an enum value 
  - Every enum has a static `values()` method 
    - Returns an array containing all of the enum's values 
  - "An enum is really a class"

### Wrapper Classes 
  - **Wrapper classes** exist for each primitive type 
  - Adds functionality like conversion to/from a string, autoboxing a primitive, etc. 
  - Lets you treat primitive values as objects when needed 

  - Handles "no-value" situation differently 
    - wrapper object with no value is `null`
    ```java
    private double salary; // defaults to 0.0
    privage Double salary; // defaults to null 
    ```
  #### Autoboxing/Unboxing 
    - Primitive values can be "autoboxed" into wrapper objects 
    - Behind the scenes, wrapper objects are generated 

  #### Conversion to/from String 
    - `Integer.parseInt(String numString)` converts a string representation to an int(primitive)

### Date/Time Support 
  - Completely new API based on Joda-Time 
  - The **java.time** types provide comprehensive and flexible data/time support 
    - Types like **LocalDate** provide immutable date/time values 
    - THere is a large API for manipulating values 

### Working with References 
  - **Class type** method parameters are passed by **reference**
    - The object is not copied
  
  #### final Method Parameters
    - For method parameters that are marked `final`
      - Primitive/value types: **the value can't be changed**
      - Class/reference types: **the reference can't be changed**
        - **But the object's data still can**
  
## Session 6: Strings and Arrays 

### Creating New Strings 
  - `Strings` instances are immutable: can't change their value 
  - Useful String Methods: pg 164 

### Comparing Strings 
  - Always compare strings using `equals()`, NOT with `==`
  - **String interning** - caching string literals for reuse
