## Session 5 Review Questions 
  1. What does it mean that an enum is "type safe"?
  2. Why are enum values are typically ALL_CAPS?
  3. True or False: You cannot have any other values associated with enum literals.
  4. Why are there wrapper classes?
  5. What does autoboxing do?
  6. True or False: Primitive values can be null. 
  7. What does it mean when a class creates "immutable" objects?
  8. True or False: Java.time classes must be instantiated in your code.
  9. Which data types get "passed by value" and which get "passed by reference"?
  10. What keyword allows the data type of a local variable to be inferred?

## Class Notes 
### Packages 
  Recommended Practice
  ```java
  import java.util.Date; //import just Date 
  Date d = new Date();   // Date from java.util
  ```
Why put clients in a different package, than the class code?
  - separate development vs. production

### Composition 
  - Assembling (composing) of objects 
  - **Delegation** - fulfilling a responsibility by using another object
  - "HAS-A" relationship

### Inheritance 
  - Drive more specific types from general one
  - "IS-A" relationship

// Constructors
```java
  public Clock() {
    this(LocalDateTime.now());
  }
  public Clock(LocalDateTime now) {
    setCurrent(now);
  }
  }
```

### Session 7 Review 
  - **Packages** organize and separate classes into **namespaces**.
  - `package` statement: declares a class is in a package 
  - `import` statement: identifies types from another package 
    - import not required - can always use the fully qualified name 
    - import not necessary for classes in the same package 
  - Packages affect Java access and encapsulation 
    - **Access** is indicated with `public, private`, and `protected`
    - **Default access** (package private) provides access to types in the same packages
  - **Modules** are a named, encapsulated set of packages 
    - Described by descriptor -_module-info.java_
  - Provide **explicit control** over dependencies 
    - Modules **export** packages for use by other modules 
    - Modules **require** packages that they use 
  - Modules also impose a **file structure**
    - Descriptor in root folder, with package folders underneath
