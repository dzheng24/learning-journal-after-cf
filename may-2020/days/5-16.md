Before reading Chapter 4 today, I finished the exercises from the end of Chapter 3. I liked doing "A Heap O'Trouble", which required me to use a pencil to draw and erase reference links, and "Five-Minute Mystery." 

In "Five-Minute Mystery", I had to compare two different code snippets, and understand why the first one is the better choice. 

1st:
```java
Contact[] ca = new Contact[10];
while (x < 10) {
  ca[x] = new Contact();
  x = x + 1;
}
// do complicated Contact list updating stuff with ca
```

2nd:
```java
Contact refc;
while (x < 10) {
  refc = new Contact();
  x = x + 1;
}
// do complicated Contact list updating stuff with refc
```

"With each trip through the loop, the 2nd method assigns a new object to the one reference variable, so the previously referenced object was abandoned on the heap - _unreacheable_."

## Chapter 4. Methods Use Instance Variables: How Objects Behave 

We know that objects have **state** and **behavior**, represented by **instance variables** and **methods**. 

Object has _behavior_ that acts on its _state_. In other words, **methods use instance variable values**. 

A class describes what an object _knows_ and what an object _does_. **A class is the blueprint of an object**.

### Can every object of that type have different method behavior? 

Every instance of a particular class has the same methods, but the methods can _behave_ differenty based on the value of the instance variables.
