### Life on the garbage-colletible Heap

```java
Book b = new Book();
Book c = new Book();
```

Declare two Book reference variables. Create two new Book objects. Assign the Book objects to the reference variables. 

The two Book objects are now living on the heap. 

References: 2, Objects: 2

```java
Book d = c;
```

The above line means "take the bits of _c_, make a copy of them, and stick that copy into _d_."

**Both _c_ and _d_ refer to the same object.**

**The _c_ and _d_ variables hold two different copies of the same value. Two remotes programmed to one tv.**
