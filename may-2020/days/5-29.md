## Class Notes 

**Overloading**: The same method in one class make be called in different ways

**Overriding**: The same method in different classes may be invoked with the same arguments 

### Overriding and Polymorphism 
Polymorphism: Objects of different (related) types can respond to the same method call differently. 

Polymorphism is only applicable when you have an inheritance hierarchy. 

A reference variable can hold a reference to an instance to that type, or any of its subclasses. 

**Return type is not part of the method signature.**

"Regression Testing": making sure the old code still works 

Member?
  - variable or method 

`protected` member is accessible within a subclass

### Class Object 

checkout `.getClass()`, `.getName()` methods 

Since **all** classes inherit from `Object`, its methods are available for any instance of any class. 

The `hashCode()` is used for natural ordering, returns an integer

Checkout `Objects.hash()`

### Abstract Classes 
Abstract classes are class which can't be instantiated. 
  - Abstract classes usually have **abstract methods**
    - Have no implementation (method body)
  - Subclasses **must** implement abstract methods to be concrete

**Abstract** is opposite of **concrete**
